# PageMunch - Web crawler for PHP


## Introduction

PageMunch is a simple API backed by an intelligent web crawler, that lets you extract data from any webpage on the internet in milliseconds. Whether you want to grab the best title, description and image for a page, prices, authorship, enable video embeds or more. We make it crazy easy to treat the web like a database.


## Installation
 
You can install the PHP module using Composer, simply add it to your requirements, for example:

    {
        "require": {
            "PageMunch/PageMunch": ">=0.1.0"
        }
    }

Or clone the repository directly from GitHub and use the class in the vendors directory of your Framework or elsewhere.
